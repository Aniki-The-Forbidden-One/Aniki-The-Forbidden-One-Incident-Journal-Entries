Here's some Incidents that I've dealt with during my CyberSecurity studies.

<h2> Entry #1</h2>

Date: July 23,
2024

Description: Documenting a cybersecurity incident

This incident occurred in the two phases:

1. Detection and Analysis: The scenario outlines how the organization
detected the ransomware incident. For the analysis step, the
organization contacted several organizations for technical assistance.

2. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: The scenario details some
steps that the organization took to contain the incident. For example
the company shut down their computer systems. However since they
could not work to eradicate and recover from the incident alone, they
contacted several other organizations for assistance.

Tool(s) used: None

The 5 W's: 

● Who: An organized group of unethical hackers

● What: A ransomware security incident

● Where: At a health care company

● When: Tuesday 9:00 a.m.

● Why: The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to
access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining
access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's
systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to
be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum
of money in exchange for the decryption key.

Additional notes:

1. How could the company prevent an incident like this from
occurring again?

3. Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key?

Description: Analyzing a packet capture file

Tool(s) used For this activity:

I used Wireshark to analyze a packet capture file,  a
network protocol analyzer tool that uses a graphical user interface.
Wireshark in cybersecurity allows security analysts to capture and
analyze network traffic. This can help with detecting and investigating malicious
activity.

The 5 W's:

● Who: N/A

● What: N/A

● Where: N/A

● When: N/A

● Why: N/A

Additional notes:

First time using Wireshark and first time analyze a packet capture file.
At first glance, Very confusing at first but using documentation step by step I was able to finish the task. 
I can see why it's such a powerful tool for understanding network traffic.

<h2>Entry #3</h2>

Date: July 25 2024

Description Capturing my first packet

Tool(s) used: tcpdump to capture and analyze network traffic.

Tcpdump is a network protocol analyzer that's accessed using the
command-line interface.the importance of tcpdump in
cybersecurity is that it allows security analysts to capture, filter, and analyze
network traffic.

The 5 W's:

● Who: N/A

● What: N/A

● Where: N/A

● When: N/A

● Why: N/A

Additional notes:

I'm still learning to navigate the CLI effectively. I got stuck a couple of times because I
used the wrong commands. But after carefully following the documentaion and
redoing some steps, I was able to get through this activity and capture network
traffic.

<h2>Entry #4</h2>

Date: July 27 2024 

Description: Investigate a suspicious file hash

Tool(s) used: I used VirusTotal, which is an investigative tool that analyzes
files and URLs for malicious content such as viruses, worms, trojans, and more.
It's a helpful tool to use to quickly check if an indicator of
compromise like a website or file has been reported as malicious by others in
the cybersecurity community. I used VirusTotal to analyze a file
hash, which was reported as malicious.

This incident occurred in the Detection and Analysis phase. The scenario put
me in the place of a security analyst at a SOC investigating a suspicious file
hash. After the suspicious file was detected by the security systems in place, I
had to perform deeper analysis and investigation to determine if the alert
signified a real threat.

The 5 W's: 

● Who: An unknown malicious actor

● What: An email sent to an employee contained a malicious file
attachment with the SHA-256 file hash of
54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab52
7f6b

● Where: An employee's computer at a financial services company

● When: At 1:20 p.m., an alert was sent to the organization's SOC after the
intrusion detection system detected the file

● Why: An employee was able to download and execute a malicious file
attachment via e-mail.

Additional notes

How can this incident be prevented in the future? Should we consider
improving security awareness training so that employees are careful with what
they click on?
